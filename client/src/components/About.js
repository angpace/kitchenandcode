            <p>Before making the swtich to becoming a software engineer, I was a Pastry Chef,
                working in Michelin Starred restaurants. Many people have troble understanding 
                the switch, but for me it made sense. After a while in the hospitality industry,
                your efficency, ability to problem solve, and technical skill will get you far. 
                Breaking it down in that way- can't this be applied to both jobs? 
            </p>
            <p>Join while I write about my time learning code, baking my favorite recipes- you name it.
                This is Kitchen & Code.
