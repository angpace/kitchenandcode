            <p>Hi and Welcome to Kitchen and Code! <br/>
                 My name is Angela Pace and I'm a Software Engineer with 
                a background in Hospitality. Born and raised in NYC, I've always had a passion for 
                diverse food, creativity and art. Throughout highschool, I realized that I also had a passion for Baking. 
                I followed that passion to the <strong>Culinary Institue of America</strong> in Hyde Park and graduated from their Pastry Program in 2016.
                Following graduation, I secured a position as Pastry Chef de Partie as part of the opening team at <strong>Le Coucou</strong>. 
                A year and a half later, I learned of an opportunity to join the reopening team for the Best Restaurant in the World 2017, according 
                to San Pelligrinos 50 Best. I left Le Coucou as a Junior Pastry Sous Chef and joined the Pastry Team at <strong>Eleven Madison Park</strong>. I worked through all of the Pastry Stations before becoming a Pastry lead, and 
                later a Pastry Sous Chef. Upon closing in 2020 due to the pandemic, I volunteered with a few coworkers to 
                make meals for food insecure New Yorkers. In September 2020, I moved to Ticino, Switzerland, to get married to my now-husband, Kevin.
                Kevin and I moved to London, UK in 2021, where I reopened Davies and Brook as the Pastry Chef and worked alongside 
                Chef De Cusine Dmitri Magi. January of 2022, Davies and Brook closed and I rejoined the team at <strong>Eleven Madison Park</strong> under 
                my mentor and Pastry Chef <strong>Laura Cronin</strong> as <strong>Executive Pastry Sous Chef</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>In August of 2022, I left EMP with a goal to switch careers. I was no longer passionate about being in the Restaurant Industry. 
                I attended the FlatIron School for their Software Engineering program a month later and fell in love with another profession. 
                Creativity, collaboration and innovation are mirrored in both of these careers, values that I wish to hold on to anywhere I go. 
                My blog Kitchen and Code follows my journey into becoming a Software Engineer with the past of a Pastry Chef. I'll be blogging about 
                code, building applicatons, learning new lanugages hand in hand with recipes, baking tutorials and tips and tricks in the kitchen. 
                I hope you'll join me along the way.
